## Description:

When the user visits the website (deploy link), they have the option to get a random motivational poster, make their own motivational poster, save their own and randomly generated motivational posters, and delete  posters from their poster saved posters page.

## Executing the program:

- From the main page, when the user clicks the Show Another Random Poster button, a randomly generated poster will appear.

- If they click save this poster on the main page, they can save their poster to be viewed when they click the Show Saved Posters Button.

  - If the user would like to delete any of their saved posters, they will double-click on the poster that they would like remove.

  - To go back back to the main page the user will click the Back to Main button.

- If the user would like to make their own poster, they would click the Make Your Own Poster button on the main page.

  - This button will take them to a new page, where they will input their own values that they would like to display on their poster.
  - Next, they will click the Show My Poster button and this will take them to the main page where their poster will be displayed.
  - Also, when still on the Create Your Own Motivational Poster page, if the user changes their mind and chooses not to make their own poster, they will click the Nevermind, take me back! button, it will take them back to the main page.

- Note: The users inputs on the Make Your Own Poster page, will be saved for use in future randomly generated posters. So choose wisely! ðŸ˜‰
